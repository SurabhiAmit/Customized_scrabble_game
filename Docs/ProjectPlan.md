# Project Plan


**Team 115 - Ling Yao**:

## 1 Introduction

*An Android App that implements the word game similar to Scrabble.*

## 2 Process Description
*Rational Unified Process will be followed in the software development. Requirement analysis, design, application development, and testing are the main activities of the process. Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition are the four phases of the activities.*

### Inception
- *The requirements of this app are mostly defined for us by the instructor. Based on the requirement, initial project plan, initial test plan, initial use-case model, and initial UML class model will be created.*
- *Entrance criteria: The detailed list of requirements gathered.*
- *Exit criteria: UML Class Diagram, initial use-case model, and initial project plan.*

### Elaboration
- *In this phase, we will identify the design specification, establish architectural foundation, refine the project plan, test plan, use-case model, and start to prepare the user manual.*
- *Entrance criteria: software requiment, UML Class Diagram, and its design.md.*
- *Exit criteria: revised project plan, 90% Use-case Model, Supplementary requirements including non-functional requirements, software architecture, design model, addition of test cases in test plan, and preliminary user manual.*

### Construction
- *We will develop the application using Android Studio according to the requirements and design. We will develop all features considered and test them. All of the use cases will be realized in this phase. This phase will be iterated until all of the requirements are satisfactorily met and the app is checked to be stable and mature. Inital testing will start in this phase and the bug reports will be finished.*
- *Entrance criteria: Finish all exit criterial documents and designs from Elaboration phase.*
- *Exit criteria: Realize all use cases realized, with traceability information. Integrate on adequate platform and complete system tests results. Prepare 90% user manual, complete set of architects, design code, test cases, and bug reports.*

### Transition
- *Test results will be released after the construction phase. In this phase, we will focus on fixing defects and deficiencies of the product until the product meets the specifications.User manual and test plan will also be finalized in this phase.*
- *Entrance criteria: Complete all exit criterial documents from the Construction phase.*
- *Exit criteria: Complete project including all of the final application developments and other documentation works like user manual and test plan.*
